# PMStadium_Viewer
A simple program to view the teams in Pocket Monsters Stadium (JAP) and all data relative to the pokémon.

It can also export individual pokémon as jpk1 files to use with pkhex. It is worth noting that the teams and trainers from Level 50-55 Tournament are (in theory) copies of the participants and winners of a real tournament that was held in japan.

jpk1 code heavily based on pkhex.
